TODO: Make this README better (*give implementation synopsis*) once the file structure is sorted out (*pun intended*)

1. Install py65mon from <https://github.com/ucsbieee/py65>
2. Run `make`, both in this directory and the newly-created `template` directory
3. Edit `template/game.c`
4. Run `make run` in the `template` directory
5. Open `template/dump/vram.bin` in [the VRAM dump viewer](https://arcade.ucsbieee.org/tools/vram-dump-viewer) to see what would be rendered to the screen
